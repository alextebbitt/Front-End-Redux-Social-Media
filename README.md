## Acknowledgment

First of all I would like to thank my teachers [Sofia](https://github.com/SofiaPinilla) [Germán](https://github.com/GeerDev) and [Ivan](https://github.com/ivanpuebla10) for teaching us React and for their pacience with us. We would also like to thank all of our classmates from the Bootcamp for always being there to help us resolve problems or simply to give some constructive critism.

## About the project

This project unifies everything learned so far. We will develop a social media site where users will register, login, view posts and create posts using the backend API I created in the 1st Backend Project.

## Requirements
Once the needs of the project have been analyzed, it is expected
that the student develops a frontend that is capable of the following:
● User registration.
● User login.
● That you can see the publications and create new ones.
● That the publications made by the logged in user can be edited and deleted
● Give/remove Like a post.
● Search engine for user profiles or posts
● That in your profile you can see your data and your posts
● That you can comment on the publications


Essential requirements of the project:
● Use of branches with git, when the project is finished there should be two branches, the master or main and the develop.
● Excellent README presentation.

![TheBridge](./toReadme/thebridgelogo.svg)

The project originates from the FullStack bootcamp at [TheBridge](https://www.thebridge.tech/), It consists of transferring the frontend to a previous backend project, thus achieving a Full-Stack project. The main objective is to create a functional e-commerce SPA (Single Page Application), using Redux.

## Challenges presented

This was an incredibly difficult project, given that I did not know about React a few weeks ago. It has been a steep learning curve, but I am still motivated to continue learning and gettting better.
